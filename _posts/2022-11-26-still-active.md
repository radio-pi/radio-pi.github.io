Big surprise RadioPi is still a thing.
Very concrete that means there is a completely new Python backend built on top of FastAPI.
Checkout: <https://github.com/radio-pi/python-websocket-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0>
Did you know this includes a fun little web client which is accessible via http://$IP:8000

[Hardware](/2022-11-20-setup-a-radio-pi) and [Software](/2022-11-26-setup-a-radio-pi-software).

You can find the latest APK here: <https://github.com/radio-pi/RadioPi/releases/tag/v0.3.0>
Expect some Bugs here.
