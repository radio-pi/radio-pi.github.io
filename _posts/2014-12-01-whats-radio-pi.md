title: What's Radio Pi?
category: blog
---

My project for this December was to build a radio with a Raspberry Pi. One of my key goals is to make it so simple 
that even my parents can use it. 

Used Hardware

- [Raspberry Pi B+]( http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/ )
  - micro SD card
  - LAN cable
  - cinch to cinch cable
  - [case]( https://www.pi-shop.ch/hifiberry-case-fuer-dac-und-digi-458 )
- [HiFiBerry - DAC+ with RCA connectors]( https://www.hifiberry.com/dacplus )

On the software side there is a bit glue code in node.js which expose the [MPD]( http://www.musicpd.org/ ) as REST API. And a Android App to control it. 

The Project state now in January is finished as in works for me. If you want setup this yourself or help out don't be shy, just contact me, write a issue, on twitter, or anywhere else.  (At the moment is probably a bit hard to figure out everything by yourself)
